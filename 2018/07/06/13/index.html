    <p>The paper (<a href="/speech/Use of ICT for Emergent Course Development  Case of Networked Detection in Police Training.pdf">The Use of ICT for Emergent Course Development: A Case on Networked Detection in Police Training</a>)was accepted for oral presentation at the Conference to be held on 4–6 July 2018 at the Open University of Hong Kong.

<p>With the wide use of information and communication technology (ICT) in vocational training, few research projects have been carried out on web-based emergent course development in the field of police training. The purpose of this study is to explore the emergent course development model based on an e-learning platform in order to resolve this issue of the lack of practical cases for police training in China. In this study, the design-based research method was employed. The course on Network Detection was selected and a total of 327 police participated in the training in three rounds of the course. The course lasted for 12 weeks with two hours per week and the online learning mode was employed. The five steps of emergent course development were followed, viz. course objectives, course design, course preparation, course implementation and generative course reflection and refinement. The following functions of the e-learning platform based on Moodle were used: multimedia learning resources; discussion forums; case sharing; and collaborative learning. In the learning process, the principles and methods were taught by the lecturer, while practical and real cases were shared and discussed by the students online. As a result, 50 practical cases were contributed by the students based on their own work experiences. It was found that the training students were very interested in doing the learning activities on case analysis, which were shared with peer police students. These case studies could be an important component in police training course materials. It is hoped that the outcomes of this study could be helpful for teachers in vocational training to develop emergent courses.</p>
